# Traffic-Sign-Classification-Recognition
Term project as a part of the Data Science Programming course at USF's Muma College of Business. Training, building and deploying traffic sign detection &amp; c;lassification algorithm. Implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks on Keras framework.

# Levels of the Project 
##### Level 1 - Implement a binary classifier using Keras to detect whether given image is a sign or not
##### Level 2 - Build and train a multi-class image classifier to classify signs into various types (regulatory, warning, guide etc.)
##### Level 3 - Train the classifier to detect signs in images that are not localized to include only the sign. 
##### Level 4 - Object localization in an image.
##### Level 5 - Classify the localized object in an image into various classes such as Stop, Yield, Speed Limit etc. 

# Libraries Used
Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib

# Data Sources
Self-captured images of signs in and around USF campus, Google Images, Flickr
